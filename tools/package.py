"""Builds the two release ZIPs from the extension folder.

The folder itself loads in both browsers, but its manifest names a background
script twice: background.service_worker for Chromium and background.scripts
for Firefox. Chromium lists the key it does not use as an error on the
extension's card, which people take for a failed install. Each ZIP therefore
gets a manifest with only its own browser's keys; every other file is copied
as it is.

    python3 tools/package.py

writes dist/desktop-gifs-chromium.zip and dist/desktop-gifs-firefox.zip, each
with manifest.json at its top level.
